/**
 * @defgroup CONTROL_REGISTERS \
 *           Control registers
 *
 * Control registers (CR0, CR1, CR2, CR3, and CR4) determine operating mode of the processor and the characteristics of the
 * currently executing task. These registers are 32 bits in all 32-bit modes and compatibility mode.
 * In 64-bit mode, control registers are expanded to 64 bits. The MOV CRn instructions are used to manipulate the register
 * bits. Operand-size prefixes for these instructions are ignored. The following is also true:
 * - The control registers can be read and loaded (or modified) using the move-to-or-from-control-registers forms of the
 * MOV instruction. In protected mode, the MOV instructions allow the control registers to be read or loaded (at privilege
 * level 0 only). This restriction means that application programs or operating-system procedures (running at privilege
 * levels 1, 2, or 3) are prevented from reading or loading the control registers.
 * - Bits 63:32 of CR0 and CR4 are reserved and must be written with zeros. Writing a nonzero value to any of the upper 32
 * bits results in a general-protection exception, \#GP(0).
 * - All 64 bits of CR2 are writable by software.
 * - Bits 51:40 of CR3 are reserved and must be 0.
 * - The MOV CRn instructions do not check that addresses written to CR2 and CR3 are within the linear-address or
 * physical-address limitations of the implementation.
 * - Register CR8 is available in 64-bit mode only. The control registers are summarized below, and each architecturally
 * defined control field in these control registers is described individually.
 * - CR0 - Contains system control flags that control operating mode and states of the processor.
 * - CR1 - Reserved.
 * - CR2 - Contains the page-fault linear address (the linear address that caused a page fault).
 * - CR3 - Contains the physical address of the base of the paging-structure hierarchy and two flags (PCD and PWT). Only
 * the most-significant bits (less the lower 12 bits) of the base address are specified; the lower 12 bits of the address
 * are assumed to be 0. The first paging structure must thus be aligned to a page (4-KByte) boundary. The PCD and PWT flags
 * control caching of that paging structure in the processor's internal data caches (they do not control TLB caching of
 * page-directory information). When using the physical address extension, the CR3 register contains the base address of
 * the page-directorypointer table. In IA-32e mode, the CR3 register contains the base address of the PML4 table.
 * - CR4 - Contains a group of flags that enable several architectural extensions, and indicate operating system or
 * executive support for specific processor capabilities.
 * - CR8 - Provides read and write access to the Task Priority Register (TPR). It specifies the priority threshold value
 * that operating systems use to control the priority class of external interrupts allowed to interrupt the processor. This
 * register is available only in 64-bit mode. However, interrupt filtering continues to apply in compatibility mode.

 *           Debug registers
 *
 * Eight debug registers control the debug operation of the processor. These registers can be written to and read using the
 * move to/from debug register form of the MOV instruction. A debug register may be the source or destination operand for
 * one of these instructions.
 * Debug registers are privileged resources; a MOV instruction that accesses these registers can only be executed in
 * real-address mode, in SMM or in protected mode at a CPL of 0. An attempt to read or write the debug registers from any
 * other privilege level generates a general-protection exception (\#GP). The primary function of the debug registers is to
 * set up and monitor from 1 to 4 breakpoints, numbered 0 though 3. For each breakpoint, the following information can be
 * specified:
 * - The linear address where the breakpoint is to occur.
 * - The length of the breakpoint location: 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes.
 * - The operation that must be performed at the address for a debug exception to be generated.
 * - Whether the breakpoint is enabled.
 * - Whether the breakpoint condition was present when the debug exception was generated.

/**
 * @brief Deterministic Cache Parameters Leaf
 *
 * When CPUID executes with EAX set to 04H and ECX contains an index value, the processor returns encoded data that
 * describe a set of deterministic cache parameters (for the cache level associated with the input in ECX). Valid index
 * values start from 0.
 * Software can enumerate the deterministic cache parameters for each level of the cache hierarchy starting with an index
 * value of 0, until the parameters report the value associated with the cache type field is 0. The architecturally defined
 * fields reported by deterministic cache parameters are documented in Table 3-8.
 * This Cache Size in Bytes
 * - = (Ways + 1) * (Partitions + 1) * (Line_Size + 1) * (Sets + 1)
 * - = (EBX[31:22] + 1) * (EBX[21:12] + 1) * (EBX[11:0] + 1) * (ECX + 1)
 * The CPUID leaf 04H also reports data that can be used to derive the topology of processor cores in a physical package.
 * This information is constant for all valid index values. Software can query the raw data reported by executing CPUID
 * with EAX=04H and ECX=0 and use it as part of the topology enumeration algorithm.
 *
 * @see Vol3A[8(Multiple-Processor Management)]

 * @brief Structured Extended Feature Flags Enumeration Leaf (Output depends on ECX input value)
 *
 * When CPUID executes with EAX set to 07H and ECX = 0, the processor returns information about the maximum input value for
 * sub-leaves that contain extended feature flags.
 * When CPUID executes with EAX set to 07H and the input value of ECX is invalid (see leaf 07H entry in Table 3-8), the
 * processor returns 0 in EAX/EBX/ECX/EDX. In subleaf 0, EAX returns the maximum input value of the highest leaf 7
 * sub-leaf, and EBX, ECX & EDX contain information of extended feature flags.

 *
 * A logical processor uses 4-level paging if CR0.PG = 1, CR4.PAE = 1, and IA32_EFER.LME = 1. With 4-level paging, linear
 * address are translated using a hierarchy of in-memory paging structures located using the contents of CR3. 4-level
 * paging translates 48-bit linear addresses to 52-bit physical addresses. Although 52 bits corresponds to 4 PBytes, linear
 * addresses are limited to 48 bits; at most 256 TBytes of linear-address space may be accessed at any given time.
 * 4-level paging uses a hierarchy of paging structures to produce a translation for a linear address. CR3 is used to
 * locate the first paging-structure, the PML4 table. Use of CR3 with 4-level paging depends on whether processcontext
 * identifiers (PCIDs) have been enabled by setting CR4.PCIDE.

   * processor interprets the segment limit in one of two ways, depending on the setting of the G (granularity) flag:
   * - If the granularity flag is clear, the segment size can range from 1 byte to 1 MByte, in byte increments.
   * - If the granularity flag is set, the segment size can range from 4 KBytes to 4 GBytes, in 4-KByte increments.
   * The processor uses the segment limit in two different ways, depending on whether the segment is an expand-up or an
   * expand-down segment. For expand-up segments, the offset in a logical address can range from 0 to the segment limit.
   * Offsets greater than the segment limit generate general-protection exceptions (\#GP, for all segments other than SS) or
   * stack-fault exceptions (\#SS for the SS segment). For expand-down segments, the segment limit has the reverse function;
   * the offset can range from the segment limit plus 1 to FFFFFFFFH or FFFFH, depending on the setting of the B flag.
   * Offsets less than or equal to the segment limit generate general-protection exceptions or stack-fault exceptions.
   * Decreasing the value in the segment limit field for an expanddown segment allocates new memory at the bottom of the
   * segment's address space, rather than at the top. IA-32 architecture stacks always grow downwards, making this mechanism

 *
 * When the S (descriptor type) flag in a segment descriptor is clear, the descriptor type is a system descriptor. The
 * processor recognizes the following types of system descriptors:
 * - Local descriptor-table (LDT) segment descriptor.
 * - Task-state segment (TSS) descriptor.
 * - Call-gate descriptor.
 * - Interrupt-gate descriptor.
 * - Trap-gate descriptor.
 * - Task-gate descriptor.
 * These descriptor types fall into two categories: system-segment descriptors and gate descriptors. Systemsegment
 * descriptors point to system segments (LDT and TSS segments). Gate descriptors are in themselves "gates," which hold
 * pointers to procedure entry points in code segments (call, interrupt, and trap gates) or which hold segment selectors
 * for TSS's (task gates).

/**
 * @defgroup APIC \
 *           Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC)
 *
 * Software interacts with the local APIC by reading and writing its registers. APIC registers are memory-mapped to a
 * 4-KByte region of the processor's physical address space with an initial starting address of FEE00000H. For correct APIC
 * operation, this address space must be mapped to an area of memory that has been designated as strong uncacheable (UC).
 *
 * @remarks Registers are 32 bits, 64 bits, or 256 bits in width; all are aligned on 128-bit boundaries. All 32-bit
 *          registers should be accessed using 128-bit aligned 32-bit loads or stores. Some processors may support loads and stores
 *          of less than 32 bits to some of the APIC registers. This is model specific behavior and is not guaranteed to work on all
 *          processors. Any FP/MMX/SSE access to an APIC register, or any access that touches bytes 4 through 15 of an APIC register
 *          may cause undefined behavior and must not be executed. This undefined behavior could include hangs, incorrect results or
 *          unexpected exceptions, including machine checks, and may vary between implementations. Wider registers (64-bit or
 *          256-bit) must be accessed using multiple 32-bit loads or stores, with all accesses being 128-bit aligned.

 * the graphics display. This memory type is available in the Pentium Pro and Pentium II processors by programming the
 * MTRRs; or in processor families starting from the Pentium III processors by programming the MTRRs or by selecting it
 * through the PAT.

 * write-back memory type reduces bus traffic by eliminating many unnecessary writes to system memory. Writes to a cache
 * line are not immediately forwarded to system memory; instead, they are accumulated in the cache. The modified cache
 * lines are written to system memory later, when a write-back operation is performed. Write-back operations are triggered
 * when cache lines need to be deallocated, such as when new cache lines are being allocated in a cache that is already
 * full. They also are triggered by the mechanisms used to maintain cache consistency. This type of cache-control provides
